IRSlideMenuController (objc)

-----

It's kind of universal iOS app with some limitation.

(For iPhone)

- it is supported for potrait mode only

(For iPad)
- suitable for landscape mode as the slide become side-by-side.

We can change these parameter at Info.plist use code view.

* in early stage of development, support left menu only.
* recreating stuff like slide menu 
* gesture right swipe
* left gesture pan. revealing bit by bit.

* inspired from SlideMenuController.swift (now converting to obj-c) and JASidePanelController
